# Contributing to Scorecard
Thank you for your interest in contributing to Scorecard. This section will be extended as we get closer to a release. For now, we're keeping this simple.

## Testing
As is obvious by the repo, I haven't implemented any testing yet. However, before I launch this, I am planning on having a test suite included. If you're interested in helping out with a test suite, feel free to contact me.

## Submitting Changes
Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done. We can always use more test coverage.

## Reporting Issues
Please add issues using the GitHub Issues. As always, the more information you can provide me, the better.

_Thank you for your interest in helping out!_
